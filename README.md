This a kakeibo journal. An app to help you manage your household finances in a mindful manner and help you achieve short term savings goals. 

Insight: the journal provides you with insight on your families daily spending, not only on the who spend how much where, but also by classifying the expenses not only in the quantitative, standard fixed and variable expenses, but also in qualitive classification:

 - Needs: For instance your food shopping, or the utilities. 
 - Wants: For instance a bottle of wine, or a book.   
 - Leisure: Sports, newspapers or the cinema spring to mind. 
 - Unexpected: All those expenses your were not expecting to make, but need to make to run the household. For instance your drying rack breakes and a new one needs to be bought. That is an unexpected expense, that piece of cheese cake you couldn't resist while shopping in town would be a want.

We could consider more qualitative classifications but these are the classic Japanese classification with the exception of culture which I broadend to leisure which can include cultural things but also sports and other activities like recreational motorcycling.

Once you have gained insights you could start added specific savings goals. Not just monetary savings goals, but more tangible goals like buying that expensive Le Crueset Dutch oven which you want be could honestly do without. Or that perfect but slightly expensive present for grandma.

Every period (month or four weeks) a rapport gets generated showing you who spend the household budget, where they did, on what they did spend. If you kept the budget if the savings goal was met. You can create notes on the spending that period and why or why not you met your goals.

Everyone that makes household expenses can be a user, should be a user, of the journal to get an accurate overview of the household expenses. 

A user account is made up of an email address and a password. Users are differentiated in super users that have all the administrative rights, and users that have limited access to the journal. For instance a superuser can create both fixed entries and variable entries in the journal, a regular user only can add variable entries. A superuser can set a user inactive if need be and can elevate regular users to superusers.
